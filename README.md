# Southpaw75

The Southpaw75 is a budget 60% with a southpaw numpad. It supports Cherry MX and Alps switches.

To purchase PCBs from your vendor of choice, simply upload the gerber zips to their website and follow the instructions from there.

# Assembly:
## 1. Bend the legs of all your diodes so they look like this:

## 2. Put the diodes through the PCB so the legs stick out the front side of the board and so the diode is flush with the back, making sure the black line on the diode faces the square pad:

## 3. Solder from the back and snip the legs:

## 4. Repeat for all diodes (you will have to solder 78, and you will have several extras)
## 5. Solder your reset button to the PCB (use tweezers to hold it down, as the metal will conduct heat from your iron and burn your finger)
## 6. Place your Pro Micro or Elite C onto its pin headers and sit it into the board so the Pro Micro is on the back of the PCB (the side with the Southpaw logo) and tape it down to temporarily hold it in place. This helps align the pin headers properly. **DO NOT SOLDER THE PRO MICRO OR ELITE C TO THE PIN HEADERS YET!**

## 7. Solder in the pin headers from the front side of the PCB. **Do not solder the Pro Micro or Elite C yet, just the headers!**

## 8. Attach your stabs to the PCB (some PCB stabs might be a tight fit with the plate; do not be afraid to push, you won't break it)
## 9. Mount switches in the corner of the plate to align it, then lower the plate onto the PCB
## 10. Add the rest of your switches and solder them all in
## 11. Once you have verified that all your diodes, switches, and Pro Micro or Elite C pin headers are soldered properly, you can now solder your Pro Micro or Elite C onto the pin headers:

## 12. Attach standoffs to the bottom of the plate using screws from the other side
## 13. Screw on the bottom plate
